My capstone idea for the Data Analytics professional certificate with Imperial College is centered around using geospatial data to assess mortgage risks, specifically focusing on flood risk. 
The idea leverages geospatial data and risk assessment algorithms to provide valuable insights into mortgage risks, particularly focusing on flood risk. This can be beneficial for lenders and investors in making informed decisions about property investments and loan approvals. The integration of geocoding and geospatial visualization enhances the ability to analyze and communicate these risks effectively.
